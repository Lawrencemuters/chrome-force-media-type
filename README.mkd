Force Media-Type Chrome Extension
=================================

This extension adds an entry to the link context (right-click) menu, allowing
you to open it while forcing a particular media type (MIME). Work around
annoying web sites that force you to download source code or text files to view
them rather than simply allowing you to view them in the browser.
